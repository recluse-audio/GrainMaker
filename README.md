# GrainMaker

This is a general granular synthesis platform for all sorts of audio transformations.
It includes JUCE and my own RD (Ryan's DSP) libraries as submodules.

This project is heavily test-driven and will remain largely written by human hands.
Although I use my fair share of claude code and chatgpt, but all is written/read by me.

AFter cloning, be sure to run ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` to get the submodules.

Until this README is updated, this project is in-progress. Open to suggestions!
